# Cryptorgraphy_RSA

A C++ implementation of RSA, an asymmetric cryptography scheme. 
 
- This project will have:
  - Computation of greatest common divisor using Euclid algorithm 
  - Computation of modulo inverse using extended Euclid algorithm
  - A fast efficient way to compute exponents
  - A randomized primality testing process
  - A random prime number generator

- Functionality of this RSA scheme will be:
  - It should be able to find a public key given a private key
  - It will be able to select two large prime numbers
  - It can perform both encryption and decryption


You will need to install [boost](https://www.boost.org/), a C++ library for large numbers. On Mac, if you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed, run the following:
```bash
brew install boost 
```
