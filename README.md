# Cryptorgraphy_RSA

A C++ implementation of RSA, an asymmetric cryptography scheme.
 
- This project will have:
  - Computation of greatest common divisor using Euclid algorithm 
  - Computation of modulo inverse using extended Euclid algorithm
  - A fast efficient way to compute exponents
  - A randomized primality testing process

- Functionality of this RSA scheme will be:
  - It should be able to find a public key given a private key
  - It will be able to select two large prime numbers
  - It can perform both encryption and decryption
