# Cryptorgraphy_RSA

A C++ implementation of RSA, an asymmetric cryptography scheme.
 
-This project will have:
  -computing greatest common divisor using Euclid algorithm 
  -computing modulo inverse using extended modulo inverse
  -a fast efficient way to compute exponents
  -a randomized primality testing. 

-Functionality of this RSA scheme will be:
  - It should be able to find a public key given a private key
  - It will be able to select two large prime numbers
  - It can fo both encryption and decryption
